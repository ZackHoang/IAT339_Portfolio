        <h2>About</h2>
        <p>
          My name is Viet Anh Hoang, but call me Zack! I am currently a
          third-year student studying at the School of Interactive Arts and
          Technology (SIAT) at Simon Fraser University. Focusing on full-stack
          web development, I want to bring out elegant, easy to follow solutions
          and workflow for developing both front-end sites with React as well as
          back-end servers using ExpressJS and PostgreSQL. As a primarily
          self-taught developer who has mastered the fundamentals, I also love
          making small open sources contribution that could help others better
          experience their application.
