            >Where's Waldo/Where's Wally</a
          >, here's how it work: in a picture filled with countless of
          characters, you must find Wally and any other specified characters as
          fast as possible. Traditionally you can play this on specific books,
          but the web allows you to build something like this too!

          <h3>Game Selection</h3>
          <p>
            Game data is loaded from the back end, which is then served to
            client side.
          </p>

          <p>We can build a simple timer that counts up in React</p>

          <h3>Character Selection</h3>
          <p>
            Characters could be and coordinate would be tracked from the top
            left corner as <code>(0, 0)</code>. Then, characters could be
            selected and a message would appear.
          </p>
          <p>
            If a character is successfully found, a success message shows up.
          </p>
          <video controls src="./video/success.mp4"></video>
          <p>Otherwise, a fail message would appear instead.</p>

          <h3>Score Logging</h3>
          <p>
            Once the player is finished, a form will appear for them to log
            their score in. This form optionally takes in the player's name. If
            no name is provided, their name will be <code>anon</code> by
            default.

          <p>
            "Other than a database connection, why a seperate back end even?" -
            Because other than logging users score, a back end is useful for
            other reasons:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <span class="li-bold">Prevent score cheating</span>: clients can
              modify the source code on the front end and just submit a fake
              score. To prevent this, we can calculate the total time on server
              side!
            </li>
            <li>
              <span class="li-bold">Checking characters coordinates</span>: you
              don't want the clients to know the exact coordinates, do you?
              Throw that in the database!
            </li>
            <li>
              <span class="li-bold">Checking for found characters</span>: This
              could arguably done on front end as well but to keep things
              simple, we can make use of users' session to store their character
              found data (it's just a few booleans check...)

          <h3>Routes</h3>
          <p>
            To facilitate this process, I created a few routes in my API in
            which that my front end app can interact with.
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li><code>/games</code>: fetch a list of game data to client</li>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <code>/games/{id}</code>: fetch the game's picture and any
                characters that needed to be found. At the same time, log user's
                epoch time when reached this route into their session data.
              </li>
              <li>
                <code>/games/{id}/{name}</code>: receive a character's
                coordinates on client side, normalize them and compare them to
                existing coordinates saved in the database.
                <ul>
                  <li>
                    If a character is found, mark them as found and return a
                    success message
                  </li>
                  <li>If not, return a fail message</li>
                  <li>
                    If a character is already found, return an already found
                    message
                  </li>
                </ul>
              </li>
              <li>
                <code>/total-time</code>: returns a player's total time in
                minutes and seconds, converted from miliseconds since epoch.
                Save this total time into their session data. If a player's
                start time could not be found, an error message will be sent
                back.
              </li>
              <li>
                <code>/score</code>: receive player's name in JSON. Save their
                name into the database as well as their total time that was
                saved from <code>/total-time</code> route
              </li>
              <li>
                <code>/leaderboard</code>: view all records of users who have
                completed the game.
              </li>
            </ul>
